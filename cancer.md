Cancer seems to be pretty prevalent, which sucks. I’ve been keeping an eye out for unconventional approaches which increase the chances of remission.


If that interests you, here are a couple of links to check out:

- harpers article: [Starving your way to vigor] https://cloudup.com/cgrXJBHXyeo
-  somewhat related http://discovermagazine.com/2013/april/19-double-edged-genes no igf-1 like the ecuadorian dwarfs with laron syndrome. no cancer or alzheimers.
- meatheals testimonial and search

A quick summary of the links:

Fasting can increase your chances of beating cancer, according to some studies referenced by the “starving your way to vigor” article in Harper’s magazine. The article notes that if you fast for four days before chemo, you won’t lose your hair. The article is long but I enjoyed it a lot.

If you actually want to eat, carnivore is the easy version of keto, and consists of zero sugar/carbs, unlike keto as commonly practiced. Check out this guy who had zero chemo side effects while on carnivore: http://meatheals.com/?s=Cancer
