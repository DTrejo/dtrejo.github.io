Cancer seems to be pretty prevalent, which sucks. I’ve been keeping an eye out for unconventional approaches which increase the chances of remission. I'm not a doctor, nor a scientist. I merely present these as intriguing articles which seem to offer promising research areas. If one were feeling adventurous or desperate, one might consider experimenting with one's way of (not) eating.

If that interests you, here are a few articles to check out:

- Harper's article: [Starving your way to vigor: The benefits of an empty stomach
 (offical)](https://harpers.org/archive/2012/03/starving-your-way-to-vigor/). Or, [read free](https://cloudup.com/cgrXJBHXyeo).  
    **Summary**: Fasting can increase your chances of beating cancer, according to some studies. The article notes that if you fast for four days before chemo, you won’t lose your hair. The article is long but I enjoyed it a lot.
-  Discovery Magazine article: ["Rare Form of Dwarfism Protects Against Cancer"](http://discovermagazine.com/2013/april/19-double-edged-genes)  
    **Summary**: Ecuadorian dwarf's with Laron syndrome have no IGF-1 growth hormone. They have little to no cancer, or Alzheimer’s.
- [Meatheals report: man experiences no chemo side effects](https://meatheals.com/2019/03/03/matthew-s/)  
    **Summary**: Man experienced no chemo side effects while eating carnivore, except for when he ate carbs/sugar. Also, check out the [rest of the Meatheals reports which mention cancer](https://meatheals.com/?s=Cancer). If you actually want to eat, rather than fast, I feel that carnivore is the easy version of keto, and consists of zero sugar/carbs, unlike keto as commonly practiced.
