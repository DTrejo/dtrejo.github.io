Hiring is a lot like dating. First let's talk about dating, then see what
lessons apply to hiring. Finally, I'll share how to position yourself as the
dominating option for your candidates. You should read this post if you are
hiring, looking to be hired, or if you wish your engineering candidates would like
you more.

The fedora you wear in your OKCupid picture both attracts and turns off
potential matches. The same goes for brown hair, and any other information you
provide on your profile. Providing *less* information is usually a bad idea —
you'll end up matched with people who think you're someone else (potentially
wasting both your time and theirs). Are you a smoker? You probably don't want
to hang out with someone who's always hassling you to quit.

I'd say there's two main ways that a relationship gets started:

1. You're friends. There's maybe a spark here or there, but it's not really the
  right time. A year or two passes, and suddenly you realize "hey! I really like
  this person!". Your hangouts transform into dates, and ¡Voila!, you're dating!
2. You're waiting in line, or at a coffee shop. Someone catches your eye. You
  make a stupid comment about how great the weather is, or ask what book they're
  reading. It turns into a real conversation, you exchange contact information,
  and declare you're interested in seeing them. *Maybe* you end up seeing them
  again, *maybe* things go well on the first few dates. ¡Voila!, you're dating!

## On to Hiring

It is generally agreed that referral hires are the best. My definition of a
referral hire is this: both people are friends, and speak semi-regularly about
work, life, and maybe they even sail yachts together, or debate the best way to
make coffee. One person refers the other person to the recruiting team, and the
hiring conversation starts.

Some companies continue to make 50% of their hires through referrals even when
they reach a size of 500+.

Why are referral hires the best? Also, what are some good ways to "simulate"
referral hires even after your company is big enough that you've "run out" of
referral hires to make?

Making a referral hire is most similar to graduating a friendship to a
relationship. Both parties have a similar amount of information (their room is
messy, they are nice, they dislike broccoli but love soft-drinks). Here is the
big one: **you can see into their mind**, and vice versa. It will be no secret
that the company does not have great code coverage, but it's okay, because some
things you just let slide. That your friend would consider referring you sends
even more signals:

- They think they'd enjoy working with you
- They think you'd be a good "fit"
- They might kick back the referral reward they get :)

But also, as a candidate you wouldn't consider applying unless your friend's
experiences at the job were positive. After all, your friend can't help but
complain about work occasionally, so you have a pretty good idea of what you'd
be getting into.

Thus, even before you send in your resume, or talk to the recruiting team,
you've already made a decision that yes, you'd consider working with them. The
process looks very different when you have no idea what you're getting into —
the candidate ends up having to both show their skill to the company *and*
determine whether they like the company (and people) enough to work there.

It's pretty opaque whether companies do referral hiring well. It's really
obvious when a company gets "cold" hiring correct. When you think of the best
places to work, who comes to mind first for you? For me, it is Fog Creek
Software. Why? Because Joel has invested so much effort taking photos of his
physique, writing prose showing how romantic he is, and demonstrating that he
knows how to treat his significant other *right*. Please excuse the mixed
metaphor, trying to throw in a bit of humor. Great, so before a candidate
has even applied, that person knows whether Fog Creek would be a good place to
work, and that Fog Creek cares a lot about keeping employees happy. In other
words, Joel has fully completed his dating profile.

Sharing more information makes "cold" candidates friendlier, and you'll get way
more compliments on your company in cover letters and over the phone.

### A complete dating profile means...

- It's easy to convince high quality candidates to apply
- Candidates who don't like Trello or video games will not apply
- It's easier for current employees to convince friends to join

Awesome, so now you're thinking, what should I put on my dating profile? Is it
appropriate to show off my bathing suit?

## The Toughest Questions a Candidate Will Ask

Here is a great list of questions to ask your potential employer, by Stefan
Kendall<sup>†</sup>:

1. What's the process like? How do you build software? Do you describe yourself
  as "lean", "agile", or "scrum"?
2. How do designers work with developers?
3. What's the state of automated testing? Continuous integration?
4. What *exactly* will I be working on? What's the tech stack?
5. How big are the teams? How big will my team be?
6. Is there any allowance for remote work?
7. Are there core business hours?
8. Why are you hiring? Is this a new product? Scaling? Did someone recently
  quit?
9. What's the coolest thing you've built here, personally?
10. What do you wish you had known about the company before working here?
  What's the worst part of this job?

I highly recommend you read his post, he explains why each question is
important, and how to interpret the answers.

Here are some more useful questions:

1. Do employees write technical blog posts?
2. What salary level and benefits should be expected?
3. How is your equity set up? [engineer's guide to stock options][stockoptions]
4. Do you have the empathy needed to hire marginalized populations?
  [How to hire a Lady to do Software Engineering][hirelady]
  - If they can pull this off, expect the company to be very well run
5. Do you have a ping pong table?
  - If they do, expect annoying noise at all times of day.
6. Do you have a nap room?
  - I personally like naps, research shows they make you smarter.
7. Ask an engineer at the company: "When was the last time you were so passionate
about building a feature for the company that you built it on your own time,
even though no-one asked you to build it?" [submitted by Max Seiden][max]
  - Translation: How passionate are they about their job? Is the work-environment
  conducive to passion? Their passion could just be siphoned into another
  activity, like sky-diving (which is totally legitimate, not everyone lives to
  work).

At various points in your hiring process you will answer these same questions,
but only for the candidates saavy enough to ask. Expose the answers to everyone,
and you'll level the field.

## Are You Worried That You'll Expose Sensitive Details to the World?

You shouldn't be. By sharing it all, you make your overly-private competitors
look bad. To use a terrible cliché, candidates prefer the devil they know to the
devil they don't. Plus, you get to pull this move: give your candidate a list of
the questions you've answered for them, and encourage the candidate to ask the
same questions to the other companies they are considering. Your truly awesome
company that hires only the best and has the most amazing work-environment will
finally win out over the companies who are just pretending (there's way more of
those than you'd think!). Prepare to rub your hiring skills in the faces of all
your founder friends.

At this point your hiring pipeline should be much smoother because people know
they want to join. You'll see higher quality candidates, and you will hire
them more quickly. Your only problem now? Figuring out if they are any good!

Best of luck!<br>

PS Dear friends of mine who are also engineers: what questions do you ask companies
before you consider joining? I'll love you if you send them to me: david åt
