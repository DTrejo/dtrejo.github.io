<p>This is the checklist version. Normally I'd write a story about how to do this,
but that takes more time and also is probably less reproducible.</p>



<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Have interns visit</li>
  <li>Have interns talk to your employees</li>
  <li>Have interns think your company is awesome and then apply to work with you</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="suck-points">Suck points</h3>
<p>Reasons why your event might suck, based on past experiences at meetups I
attended during my three bay area software engineering internships. Also based
on the two meetups I helped organize in summer 2011 and 2012 (the meetups I
organized didn't have these problems :).</p>

<ul>
  <li>The exec you picked to give a talk isn't great at public speaking, or wasn't
excited enough about the topic</li>
  <li>The talk went for too long</li>
  <li>You served pizza</li>
  <li>You don't serve beer</li>
  <li>Too many people show up to your event. Personally I think 40-60 is a good
number</li>
  <li>You let non-intern adults into the event (some people surf eventbrite.com for events with free food)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-not-to-suck-and-have-a-good-event">How not to suck and have a good event</h3>

<h3 id="venue--physical-stuff">Venue &amp; Physical stuff</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Name tags with the person's name and the company they work at, so people don't
have to incessantly and annoyingly ask each other where they work.</li>
  <li>Food. Burritos are a decent choice. Tacos are as well. Sushi is super pro, but
expensive ;)</li>
  <li>Have a projector for slides for your speaker</li>
  <li>Use Eventbrite, collect email name, employer, university, and graduation year,
all in different fields. You'll use this to un-invite non-students, and for
recruiting later on.</li>
  <li>At the event have a little booth sort of thing with a sign up sheet for "yes,
I'd like to work here, please ping me for my resume so we can start talking".</li>
  <li>Swag. stickers, whatever, doesn't need to be expensive or fancy or useless</li>
  <li>Chairs for people to sit down. I recommend leaving lots of space between the
rows, as well as a decent amount of space between the chairs so that people
can get through. People will turn their chairs once the talk is finished and
talk to each other, and eat their food with plenty of space to be messy and
put their trash/plate on the ground.</li>
  <li>Have beer. You can ask people if they are 21 when they sign up on Eventbrite,
and then give them little pink stickers on their name tag when they show up
and are over 21. Then you could have someone near the beer enforcing that
people are 21.</li>
  <li>If you are not on the ground floor of your building, or your doors lock, give
your phone number to attendees by modifying the Eventbrite RSVP email, and
also possibly putting a number on your locked door so people can call you if
they are locked out.</li>
  <li>Have a little table and a couple of friendly people sit there and hang out
name tags and make conversation with people.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="getting-the-word-out">Getting the word out</h3>

<ul>
  <li>DONT schedule it on the same night as ALL the other intern meetups. At least
in summer 2012, this was Thursday. Try Tuesday or something.</li>
  <li>DO have one of your interns take point on publicizing the event: this makes it
more personal and ALSO relevant to other interns, because people are like "oh,
this person I've seen around the valley and that is my age, I should listen
and maybe I'll even see them later and we'll become friends. I might actually
end up caring about this person."</li>
  <li>Every year there is an intern group on Facebook. Post to it 2 weeks before the
event, 1 week before the event, and the day before.</li>
  <li>The intern who takes point (the LEAD) will likely know interns at many other
companies. The LEAD can then ask their friends at each of these companies to
email a blurb out to that company's intern list. Here are some
companies/interns that <a href="https://twitter.com/seanzawi">Sean</a> and I emailed out to for this past meetup (emails
may/may not have been sent out, but we asked people there to send out for us):
    <ul>
      <li>mozilla</li>
      <li>learnboost</li>
      <li>uber</li>
      <li>yammer</li>
      <li>twitter</li>
      <li>zynga</li>
      <li>mixpanel</li>
      <li>stripe</li>
      <li>codeforamerica</li>
      <li>yahoo (really? Okay!)</li>
      <li>google</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Shoot an email to the folks at internmatch who have a ~500 person list of
interns in the bay (as of 2012).</li>
  <li>Big companies will send more interns, so sending off to big companies is a
bigger priority.</li>
  <li>Don't forget to have each of your interns send out to their university friends
(and acquaintances) who are in the area. Tell them not to be ashamed about
emailing, but DO give them a blurb, otherwise each one will have to spend time
writing an invitation.</li>
  <li>Of the people who RSVP on eventbrite, about 50% will show up. No, you and your
event are not special, it will be 50%. This should guide how much food you
buy.</li>
  <li>It doesn't matter if emails are sent out via personal email or work email. In
fact, personal email with the work email cc'd is almost more human &amp; friendly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="making-the-most-of-the-event-for-the-sake-of-your-company">Making the most of the event, for the sake of your company</h3>
<ul>
  <li>DO invite your full-time engineers. You should also feed them.</li>
  <li>DO have your exec talk on a topic that would be interesting to both your
full-timers and your interns. If your CTO is a good speaker, I recommend
having them give a tech talk. It is OK to get technical, people will raise
their hands. The worst thing is to have the talk go on too long, I recommend
limiting them to 15-20 minutes of speaking and then open it up to another 10
minutes of questions.</li>
  <li>ONCE THE TALK IS OVER, the LEAD should say thanks for talking, and
then CALL OUT EMPLOYEES e.g. this is Shahrooz, talk to him about
Android; this is Danny talk to him about node.js; this is <a href="https://medium.com/tech-talk/d823af31f7c">Chris</a>, talk to him
about iOS; this is Mike &amp; <a href="http://daveeddy.com/">Dave</a>, talk to them about Riak and DTrace and
keeping machines from not blowing up in a cloud of rainbow smoke. This allows
interns to go and talk to the people who interest them, and gives them a
handle on your organization so they can get more out of the meetup by asking
questions of those specific people.</li>
  <li>Your employees and interns should be wearing some sort of company swag.</li>
  <li>REMIND your employees to bring their business cards and hand them out like
cray cray. They do have cards, right?</li>
  <li>After the event, have the LEAD send an email out to everyone who RSVP'd on the
eventbrite, thanking them for coming, and encouraging them to email back if
they are interested in working at your company. Cc your hiring person on this
email to make hand-off easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have fun!<br />
David</p>
