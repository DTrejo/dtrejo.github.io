Hey there,  
Lately I've been working on [ðŸ˜º Monocle][monocle], an app which guides engineers to write more secure services and gives engineering leaders visibility into our security posture here at Chime.

Check out the two-part [article series about ðŸ˜º Monocle][monocle] on the Chime engineering blog, or the [talks at RailsConf and BSides SF][monocle].

Are you building an internal security tool at your company? Let's talk and share ideas!

ðŸ¥‚ To a more secure future,
