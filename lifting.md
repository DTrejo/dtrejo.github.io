Here’s how I got started with weightlifting in just 2 years ;) As I write this, it’s been a little over a year, and I still enjoy it a lot.

## Why Do I like Weight Lifting? Why did I start?
- You feel great when you leave the gym
- I need (another) way to feel like I have growth in my life
- It takes <30 minutes for a workout when you first start, if the gym isn’t busy
- You start feeling the results and back strength and seeing new muscles within a month (at least for me)
- Lifting is proven and sustainable long term—you can start no matter your age with just a modified program

## Step by Step
1. I watched tons of videos on the Starting Strength YouTube channel
2. Did my own non-weightlifting workouts at home, and felt a bit better, but still felt that my body and strength overall were on a slow decline
3. Went to the climbing gym regularly, but not enough
4. Started a new job where I felt I was ready to invest in my physical growth
5. Went to the gym with my friend Devin Finzer who showed me around and helped me feel more comfortable there, and signed up
6. Continued going every M W F in the morning, and made sure I slept early the night before
