# ${this.title}

## This list is for you if...
- You don't have enough top-of-funnel engineering candidates
- You want to pursue channels with higher quality candidates
- You'd like channels where you can attract engineers rather than chasing them
- You want to hire engineers from under-represented groups in technology

I leave it to you to figure out how to source from each of these channels. I've
sorted to the top the channels for which I am comfortable sharing my conversion
rates with you.

## Massive list of all hiring channels
- Cold emails to engineers (50% reply-rate and 17% interested in a call is achievable with a well-written email)
- Email newsletters – for example js weekly, node weekly, ruby weekly, and so on for your whole stack (2% click through rate is achievable with a well-written ad)
- HN who's hiring monthly (#5 post with 30 applicants/month is achievable with a well-written post)
- Airbnb
- Angellist – A-list
- Bootcamp grads
- California layoffs notifications
- Conference tours (keynote or give a talk)
- Conferences – lanyrd: speakers, attendees, sponsors can email attendees
- Contest for e.g. 1 set of free conference tickets to Velocity for example (very expensive but cool!); and 1 set of free tickets for under-represented group in tech. Also worth including: housing, for example on a not creepy teammate's couch.
