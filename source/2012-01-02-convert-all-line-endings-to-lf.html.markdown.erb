**Why?** So that you can [check your node_modules folder into git][1], whether
or not there are mixed line endings in files.

Use [dos2unix][2], which you can get using [macports][3]:

    sudo port install dos2unix

And then use it:

    dos2unix filetoconvert.js

Or if there are many offending files:

    find path/to/bad/files/ | xargs dos2unix

And then `git add` whatever you like and you'll be good to go!

> @walter: Hey, you're totally right.<br><br>The main issue is that if you try to git add a bunch of files at the same time, even with that setting set correctly, it will complain about mixed line endings and prevent your from adding those files.<br><br>This generally only happens when you try to git add files that are built or auto-generated, or that someone else wrote on a windows computer AND a linux machine, leading to mixing.
