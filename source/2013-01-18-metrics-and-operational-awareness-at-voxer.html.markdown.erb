*`sky` has been released as [zag][11]!*

Please read the article on Voxer's [no single point of failure architecture][1],
as it explains how process rings work, and how Voxer's load balancing works.

## What are the salient implementation features of our metrics solution?

Client side (on your app servers, which emit data)

  - metrics are coalesced into 1440 byte udp packets to optimize network
    efficiency
  - [handy node.js bindings][1] which allow you simply call
    `sky.counter("http_status|200")` whenever a certain call suceeds or fails
  - keys emitted with the form `http_status|200` are rolled together with keys
    of the form `http_status|404`, giving you both information on, say, 404s,
    200 OKs, AND the high-level view of how many http requests you are doing per
    minute.

Server side (on the skyservers which aggregate metrics data)

  - skyservers form a ring, and clients load balance themselves so as not to
    overwhelm a single server
  - intra-ring skyserver communication is also coalesced for efficiency.
  - load balancing allows you to add more skyservers as the number of your
    appservers grows
  - every minute, skyservers talk to a single redis server to roll-up their data
  - the redis intermediary in front of riak allows for accurate counters,
    because redis performs atomic [`INCR`][7] operations

Persisting data

  - a rollup process continuously pulls keys out of redis and puts the latest
    time period of data into redis, simultaneously performing 5-minute rollups of
    the 1 minute data, if applicable.
  - riak as our persistence medium allows us to keep historical data forever, as
    we can increase the size of our riak cluster by adding a machine.

Viewing metrics and adding new ones

  - the redis server keeps a list of keys that have recently been emitted, and exposes
    this list to our graphing UI, meaning that to begin recording a new metric,
    you need not do any configuration, simply start recording it on your app servers.
    The skygraphs UI will simply pick it up and start showing it to you.
  - the skygraphs UI will also hit redis for the latest minute's data, giving
    you real-time access to what is going on right now in your infrastructure.

## Why didn't we just use etsy's statsd and whisper and carbon?
Etsy wrote a library called [statsd][2], which works with [whisper][2] (the
backend) to record metrics data. There are a couple reasons we chose not to use
these technologies.

  - rings of servers recieving metrics is the only way we can handle the
    volume of data being recorded by our app servers
  - riak allows us to store historical data forever (just add another machine)
  - we think our [graphing UI][5] is pretty snazzy, especially since it has
    [heat maps][4]

Forthcoming: If you'd like to read about [skygraphs][5], our awesome graphing
UI, please check out [this article][5].
