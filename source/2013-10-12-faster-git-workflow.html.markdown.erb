I find myself copy-pasting long filenames way too often when I work with
git. Tab completing deep paths is just as annoying. What might be a better way?

What if `git status -s` showed me this?


    $ git status -s
    g1  M lib/child_process.js
    g2 M  lib/sys.js
    g3 ?? newfile.md


And then I could do this:


    $ vim g1
    $ git add g3
    ...


Does anyone know of a tool that allows this?

If it doesn't exist, let's see if I can make it :)

Cheers,
