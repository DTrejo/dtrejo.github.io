By popular demand, it was requested that I get a six-pack. I donâ€™t believe a six-pack is possible without extremely difficult to achieve body fat levels. But, I started doing my research anyway.  Based on my past reading, it seemed keto was the way to go. 

I never considered starting keto before because I didnâ€™t feel like counting carbs to stay under the 30 gram per day limit. Then I discovered carnivore. 

## The promise of Carnivore / Zero Carb

Unlike any other way of eating Iâ€™d previously heard of, carnivore seemed to have some uniquely easy to follow properties:

1. Eat as much as you want until full (eat the fat first)
2. Lose weight (despite the above!)
3. Gain strength (I [weight lift][1])

And, the kicker, which I discovered during my three day trial of carnivore: I felt so amazingly 10x happy. I hadnâ€™t felt that excited about a meal in years. And that happened once on day two and once on day three.

Since then, my mood has reached a new much higher baseline, which I love. As I write this, Iâ€™ve been carnivore for 7 months. My max weight before I started was 215, and lately Iâ€™ve been hovering between 194-197, with similar strength. My doctor approves of my bloodwork.

My weight lifting continues to go well, although I donâ€™t lift in the morning while fasted anymore. 

## Is Carnivore Worth Trying for *You*?
A three day trial seems pretty low risk to me. If you want any of the benefits listed above, Iâ€™d say itâ€™s at least worth a try. 

If you are still liking it after three days, consider extending it to a month to see how it feels. Week two is when you get into keto adaption (flu-like symptoms which go away after a few days).

There are definitely some down-sides, which may temper your enthusiasm:

- Social pressure to eat carbs
- Itâ€™s harder to find food that hits the quality/price sweet spot. Youâ€™ll end up cooking at home because of its dependability. Burger patties can be good, at the right place.
- My sleep changed: I sleep a bit less and it feels a bit harder to sleep in

## What I eat
I primarily eat pastured ribeye steaks from Whole Foods, and wild salmon when Iâ€™m in the mood. 

I try to eat only fresh and freshly cooked meat (histamines can make me react).

I realized early on that I didnâ€™t want to drink milk (too much sugar). Later on, I stopped eating cheese because I suspected it made me feel really tired.

I donâ€™t eat any olive oil nor other vegetable oils (ghee is higher smoke point than olive oil anyway).

If you donâ€™t know [how to buy and cook steak][2], then read my article on it ðŸ™‚. Lately though Iâ€™ve taken to preparing my steak hot-pot style: boil water, drop in steak sliced up into cubes, wait 1Â½ minutes, drain, plate, salt (optional), eat.

Iâ€˜m very optimistic about this way of eatingâ€”[meat seems to have some remarkable healing abilities for others as well][3]. 

To our health!
