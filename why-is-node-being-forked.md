As of October 9th I learned that [Node][node] is being forked!

[![Why is node being forked? tweet](./images/why-is-node-being-forked-tweet1.png)][confirmation-tweet]

I asked someone close to this, "what is the reason for the fork?"

It turns out that some contributors* are forking because Node is currently run
by a Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL), and these contributors are interested
in running it by committee.

Here is a video on the subject, where these contributors discuss the
effort:

Interesting notes from the video:

- they are considering hiring a full-time person to triage bugs on Node
- they wish they could share bug-closing and bug-management abilities on the
[joyent/node][node] Github (but Github itself does not make this easy without giving direct commit access),
- For the near-term, they are considering spending 3 hours per week doing bug
triage.

Here are the leaders of this, with their names and their rank as a contributor
to [node][node]:

- `#2` Isaac Schlueter (and former BDFL)
- `#3` Ben Noordhuis [Mikeal pointed out that I forgot Ben, thank you Mikeal!]
- `#4` Bert Belder
- `#5` Fedor Indutny
- `#7` Trevor Norris
- `#27` Mikeal Rogers

As a bystander to this, I hope that when the dust settles, Node's stability and
progress have not been adversely affected. I know for a fact that all of these
people have better things to do than forking node (running their businesses for
example). I have no doubt that this whole thing is a big headache for everyone,
and hopefully the headache goes away soon (they would not be forking if they
didn't have good reasons).

Have a good day,<br>
