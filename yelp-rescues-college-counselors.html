have bad reviews on my profile, no one is calling me. This costs me
thousands of dollars for every month that I don’t have a full class. On
top of this, some of my potential students and parents check up on my
Yelp in the process of talking to me, and go silent without any
explanation because they’ve seen the bad reviews. If my profile were
better I might have an easier time of doing workshops at my local
high-school, but as is, both the counselors and the students might not want
my advice, because their confidence in me is undermined by Yelp. I wish
Yelp did not exist, it makes me miserable. I’ve helped many students get
into college, and now a few bad reviews ruin it both for me and for
potential students who I can undoubtedly help, but who don’t end up
working with me.</blockquote><p>- B, a local bay area private college counselor

stars.

</h2></section><section><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><h3>“Yelp Rescues is too expensive”</h3><p>You are currently leaving thousands of dollars on the table every month that you let Yelp continue to drive students away. Yelp rescues will more than pay for itself within the year.</p><h3>“I don’t want to spend any more money on Yelp”</h3><p>You are currently spending on advertising that sends people to a profile page with bad reviews—this does nothing for you or your business. You spend as much as $3900/year on Yelp advertising. The cost of fixing your Yelp profile is small compared to what you stand to gain from the combination of a good profile AND Yelp advertising.</p><h3>“I’m already spending on Yelp advertising”</h3><p>Yelp advertising will not improve your reviews or stars. It will send more people to your page, but this was not helpful for my past college counselors clients because once visitors saw the low ratings they did not to call.</p><h3>“I don’t want to buy reviews”</h3><p>This service does NOT sell reviews.</p><h3>“I dont want fake reviews”</h3><p>This service does NOT post fake reviews to your profile.</p><h3>“Yelp told me I shouldn’t ask for reviews”</h3><p>Yelp gives you bad advice in order to make you more dependent on them for business. You should not listen to Yelp’s advice. Think of Yelp as a protection racket: they want you to continue to rely on their advertising and be dependent on them—if you asked for reviews, and got them, you would not need to give any attention or money to Yelp.</p><h3>“I already have a full class of students”</h3><p>Did your star ratings decline very recently? If Yelp is a big source of students for you, it’s best to take care of this problem now, before the next school year starts and you’re scrambling for students.</p><h3>“My Yelp page is beyond repair”</h3><p>I don’t believe you. Please contact me and I can tell you how much work it will be to fix it.</p><h3>“My business is too small”</h3><p>This service is designed for one-person college-counseling businesses, your business is the perfect size!</p><h3>“Others who promised Yelp improvements were not able to make it happen”</h3><p>I have helped counselors get from 1 star to 4 stars in the past. On top of my proven track record I also offer a guarantee: if we can not get you to 4 stars, I will give you all your money back.</p><h3>“I don’t have time to improve my Yelp page—I need more students ASAP!”</h3><p>You will only need to answer a emails from me within a reasonable amount of time: making use of this service does not require a significant time investment on your part (we will exchange 2-3 emails per week).</p><h3>“I can’t afford to have someone take care of this for me”</h3><p>I understand completely—for this reason we offer a mentoring option where I help you make this happen for yourself.</p><h3>“What if new reviews are all caught by the Yelp filter?”</h3><p>Some may be caught, but with persistence we will get new positive reviews from seasoned Yelp accounts through the filter and onto your Yelp profile page, boosting your star rating.</p><h3>“How will I know this is working?”</h3><p>We will start to see reviews showing up on your profile, or in your “filtered” section, and your ratings will start to rise!</p></section><section><h2>Guarantee: If together we can’t get you to 4 stars on Yelp, I will refund you in full.</h2><p>I want my clients to be overwhelmed by a flow of students who need
help, so more students can go to Ivy-league schools, graduate
debt-free, and make $100k+ after graduation, just like I did. Unlike
anyone else who might help you, I believe 100% in what you do, and am
eternally grateful for the work my own private college counselor did
to help me.
