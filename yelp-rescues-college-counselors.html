have bad reviews on my profile, no one is calling me. This costs me
tens of thousands of dollars for every month that I don’t have a full class.
Some of my potential students and parents even check up on my
Yelp in the process of talking to me, and go silent without any
explanation because they’ve seen the bad reviews. If my profile were
better I might have an easier time of doing workshops at my local
high-school, but as is, both the counselors and the students might not want
my advice, because their confidence in me is undermined by Yelp. I wish
Yelp did not exist, it makes me miserable. I’ve helped many students get
into college, and now a few bad reviews ruin it both for me and for
potential students whom I can undoubtedly help, but who don’t end up
working with me.</blockquote><p>- B, a local Bay Area private college counselor</p><p>If a 1-star Yelp rating turns away <strong>one</strong> student per
month, then you’re losing out on between $48,000 and $132,000 of
income opportunity per year. These numbers are based on my survey of publicly
listed 1-year packages offered by private college counselors in the
Bay Area—the cheapest package is ~$4,000 per year and the most
expensive is ~$11,000 per year. If your rating is turning away
<strong>ten</strong> students a month, the business is losing out on
between $480,000 and $1,320,000 worth of opportunities. To add insult
to injury, Yelp could be charging you ~$325 per month, or $3900 per
year, for advertising that is not effective.
</p><p>When potential clients search “[Your Name] Yelp” on Google, the bad
rating shows up, making them less likely to want to work with you.
This situation is unfair to you and your business—you’ve helped
hundreds of students get into amazing colleges and get millions of
dollars in merit money. It is important that we limit or reverse the
damage caused by these reviews, so that Yelp stops hobbling your
business, and you can focus on other areas of growth.
</p><p>We need to turn Yelp around so it won’t cost you any more new
business. We also need to lay the foundation for other sources of
leads, and take away Yelp's power to ruin enrollment in counseling
with you. To accomplish this, there are three main strategies we can
pursue.

reviews that are killing their business by getting them back to 4
stars.
</h2></section><section><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>“I hate Yelp. Can you delete my page?”</h3><p>Yelp's business model is a protection racket just like the mafia run against small Sicilian store-owners. Your business hums along, doing just great, with word of mouth sending you tons of students. Suddenly, Yelp creates a page for you, a few bad reviews show up, and you start getting fewer and fewer calls. Yelp starts calling you: "Hey there, wanna advertise on Yelp? Want more clients?" You think "Oh great, I'd love more clients, I guess I only have one star, but I have to do <em>something</em>, right?" And then Yelp fleeces you. It turns out that sending more traffic to a page with a low rating is really not effective. Conveniently, Yelp didn't tell you this. I'm here to make all this disappear. We'll get you to four stars, and then you'll be able to forget about Yelp <strong>forever</strong>.</p><h3>“I don’t want to spend any more money on Yelp.”</h3><p>You are currently spending on advertising that sends people to a profile page with bad reviews—this does nothing for you or your business. You spend at least $3900/year on Yelp advertising. The cost of fixing your Yelp profile is small compared to what you stand to gain from the combination of a good profile AND Yelp advertising.</p><h3>“I’m already spending on Yelp advertising.”</h3><p>Yelp advertising will not improve your reviews or stars. It will send more people to your page, but this was not helpful for my past college counselor clients because once visitors saw the low ratings they did not call.</p><h3>“I don’t want to buy reviews.”</h3><p>This service does NOT sell reviews.</p><h3>“I dont want fake reviews”</h3><p>This service does NOT post fake reviews to your profile.</p><h3>“Yelp told me I shouldn’t ask for reviews.”</h3><p>Yelp gives you bad advice in order to make you more dependent on them for business. You should not listen to Yelp’s advice. Yelp is a protection racket: they want you to continue to rely on their advertising and be dependent on them—if you asked for reviews, and got them, you would not need to give any attention or money to Yelp.</p><h3>“I already have a full class of students.”</h3><p>Did your star ratings decline very recently? If Yelp is a big source of students for you, it’s best to take care of this problem now, before the next school year starts and you’re scrambling for students.</p><h3>“My Yelp page is beyond repair.”</h3><p>I don’t believe you. Please contact me and I can tell you how much work it will be to fix it.</p><h3>“My business is too small.”</h3><p>This service is designed for one-person college-counseling businesses, your business is the perfect size!</p><h3>“Others who promised Yelp improvements were not able to make it happen.”</h3><p>I have helped counselors get from 1 star to 4 stars in the past. On top of my proven track record I also offer a guarantee: <strong>if together we can not get you to 4 stars, I will give you all your money back.</strong></p><h3>“I don’t have time to improve my Yelp page—I need more students ASAP!”</h3><p>You will only need to answer emails from me within a reasonable amount of time: making use of this service does not require a significant time investment on your part.</p><h3>“I can’t afford to have someone take care of this for me.”</h3><p>I understand completely—for this reason I offer a mentoring option where I help you make this happen for yourself.</p><h3>“What if new reviews are all caught by the Yelp filter?”</h3><p>Some may be caught, but with persistence we will get new positive reviews from seasoned Yelp accounts through the filter and onto your Yelp profile page, boosting your star rating.</p><h3>“How will I know this is working?”</h3><p>We will start to see reviews showing up on your profile, or in your “filtered” section, and your ratings will start to rise!</p></section><section><h2>Guarantee: If together we can’t get you to 4 stars on Yelp, I will refund you in full.</h2><p>I want my clients to be overwhelmed by a flow of students who need
help, so more students can go to Ivy-league schools, graduate
debt-free, and make $100k+ after graduation, just like I did. Unlike
anyone else who might help you, I believe 100% in what you do, and am
eternally grateful for the work my own private college counselor did
to help me.
</p></section><section><h2>Options</h2><p>Yelp, in its current state, will cause your business to lose out on
over $48,000 in opportunities this year if it turns away one student a
month, and over $480,000 in opportunities if it turns away 10 students
a month. Let's fix Yelp and take it out of the picture so you can
focus on the true growth areas of your business and stop worrying
about Yelp robbing you of your potential.
